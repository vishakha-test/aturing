						<p class="universal-h2-j"><span></span>During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of
							German ciphers at Bletchley Park.
							From September 1938, Turing worked part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School
							(GC&CS), the British codebreaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the
							Enigma cipher machine used by Nazi Germany. the Polish Cipher Bureau gave details of the
							wiring of Enigma machine's rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma machine's messages,
							Turing and Knox developed a broader solution.Turing's approach was more general, using
							crib-based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe.
							Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940. On 4 September 1939, UK declared war on Germany.
							Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made
							during the war. Developing a procedure dubbed Turingery for working out the cam settings of
							the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40/42 (Tunny) cipher machine and, towards the end of the war,
							the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed
							Delilah.
							By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code
							breaking process, Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers
							discussing mathematical approaches, titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography
							and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions.</p>

							In July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed Turingery for use against the Lorenz cipher
							messages produced by the Germans new Geheimschreiber (secret writer) machine.
							Between 1945 and 1947, he worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at
							the National Physical Laboratory (NPL)
							In 1948, Turing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria
							University of Manchester. A year later, he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine
							Laboratory, where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers
							IN 1995, he turned to mathematical biology, finally publishing his masterpiece "The Chemical
							Basis of Morphogenesis" in January 1952. He was interested in morphogenesis, the development
							of patterns and shapes in biological organisms</p>
