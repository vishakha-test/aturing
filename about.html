						<h2 class="universal-h2 universal-h2-bckg">About</h2>
						<p class="universal-h2-j"><span>A</span> lan Mathison Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist,
							logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly
							influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of
							the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a
							model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of
							theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.ercepted coded messages that
							enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of
							the Atlantic. Due to the problems of counterfactual history, it is hard to estimate the
							precise effect Ultra intelligence had on the war.However, Professor Jack Copeland has
							estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over
							14 million lives.
							After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the
							Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In
							1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of
							Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in
							mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted
							oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in
							the 1960s. Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised in his home country
							during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.
							Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts; the Labouchere Amendment of 1885 had
							mandated that "gross indecency" was a criminal offence in the UK. He accepted chemical
							castration treatment, with DES, as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days
							before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as a
							suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental
							poisoning.
							In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an
							official public apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was
							treated". Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013. The "Alan Turing
							law" is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom.Turing has an extensive
							legacy with statues of him, many things named after him including an annual award for
							computer science innovations. He is due to appear on the Bank of England £50 note, to be
							released in June 2021. A 2019 BBC series, as voted by the audience, named him the greatest
							person of the 20th century.</p>
